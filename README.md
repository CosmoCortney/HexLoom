# HexLoom
HexLoom is a simple tool for editing binary data, similar to a hex editor. But instead of editing all binary data directly, all edits are saved in a separate file, which can be applied 
only to the export file while retaining the original file. This allows you to easily undo changes and keep the original file intact. This makes finding and eliminating errors easier.
